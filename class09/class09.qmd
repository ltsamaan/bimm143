# PDB Statistics:

The PDB is the main database for structural information on biomolecules. 

```{r}
db <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names = 1)
db
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
xray.total <- sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", db$X.ray)))
em.total <- sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", db$EM)))
em.total
xray.total
```

Write a function to get rid of repetitive code:

```{r}
# x is the input. 
sum_comma <- function(x) {
  # Substitute the comma and covert to numeric. 
  sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x)))
}

sum_comma(db$X.ray)
sum_comma(db$EM)
sum_comma(db$Total)
```

For Xray:
```{r}
sum_comma(db$X.ray) / sum_comma(db$Total)
```

For EM:
```{r}
sum_comma(db$EM) / sum_comma(db$Total)
```

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
round(sum_comma(db$Total[1]) / sum_comma(db$Total), 2)
```

> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

# Visualizing the HIV-1 protease structure:

> Q6.
![HIV-PR structure from MERK with a bound drug](1HSG-2.png)


> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

This structure is too low a resolution to see H atoms. You need a sub Angstrom resolution to see Hydrogen.

> Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have?

HOH308

# Working with Structures in R

We can use the `bio3d` package to read and perform bioinformatics calculations on PDB structures. 

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```
```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

Read an ADK structure:

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

Perform a prediction of flexibility with a technique called NMA(normal code analysis):

```{r}
# Perform flexibility prediction
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```

Write out. "movie" (a.k.a trajectory) of the motion for viewing in M0lstar:

```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```

> Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 

198

> Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 

HOH

> Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure?
